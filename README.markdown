Atmospheric Scattering
======================

Simulates atmospheric scattering from the perspective of a camera on the
surface of an Earth-like planet.

Requirements:
-------------
* Windows 8
* Visual Studio 2012

To build the project, open `Scattering.sln` and run on Debug settings. The
program has not been tested in Release mode, and a known issue prevents it from
closing when the window has been destroyed.
